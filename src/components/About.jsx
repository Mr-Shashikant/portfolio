My CSS skills have earned me the title of "CSS Master" among peers, though I also have a solid command of JavaScript. To enhance my productivity, I am currently learning React and expanding my skills in modern web development. Additionally, I have experience with Figma for UI/UX design and understand Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. My passion for technology extends beyond developmentâ€”I actively participate in IT-related competitions, having won multiple medals, even at the state level, in the annual quiz competition organized by my school's parent organization. I also hold 15+ certifications in various programming languages from different platforms.</p>
